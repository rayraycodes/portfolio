This profound experience fueled my belief in technology's power to make significant societal impacts, guiding me to collaborate with the MIT Game Lab. There, I immersed myself in exploring how gaming could revolutionize learning, pushing the boundaries of education in math and science.</p>\n<h2>Continuous Learning</h2>\n<p>My calling demanded me to the University of Michigan. Here, I am embracing diverse cultures and experiences, all while maintaining a student's mindset—open, curious, and learning every day. As a student, I'm on a continuous quest to explore the depths of self and the world around me, always inspired by the endless possibilities of technology and driven by the desire to make a difference.</p>\n<h2>A Closing Note</h2>\n<p>In sharing my story, I extend a \"Namaste\" to you—the spirit in me bows to the spirit in you.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to join me on this journey.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
