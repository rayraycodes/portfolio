By virtue of my prior travels to the US in 2019, the US Embassy kindly waived my visa interview, sparing me the agony of languishing in a lengthy queue. Armed with my I-20, passport, and Sevis receipt, I entrusted these documents to the delivery bank to submit on my behalf. After a week's time, the US Embassy contacted me, revealing that an in-person interview would, in fact, be required. Navigating the interview appointment process proved to be a breeze, and I found myself scheduled for an appointment the following week.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eHowever, at the interview, the visa officer issued me a 221g pink slip, leaving me again in a state of unease. As the weeks passed and my passport had been returned, my anxiety mounted as I anxiously awaited word on my visa status. After months of uncertainty and fruitless inquiries, all hope seemed lost. But, buoyed by patience and determination, I persisted, checking the visa application portal and sending numerous emails to the US Embassy. And then, at long last, I received the news I had been longing for: my visa had been granted. This arduous journey demanded much of me, but the investment of hope and perseverance was richly rewarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eWith a heavy heart and eager anticipation, I bade farewell to my loved ones and embarked on a journey with Qatar Airlines to begin my life as a graduate student at the esteemed University of Michigan-Dearborn in the United States. Despite my sadness at parting with those dear to me, I felt a surge of excitement as I eagerly anticipated the adventures that awaited me. As the flight progressed, I made a vow to capture every moment of my journey to share with the world via my regular vlogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eMid-flight, I was thrilled to learn that the most highly anticipated football match of the year was taking place - the World Cup Final, pitting France against Argentina. Filled with the spirit of the moment, I eagerly hoped that Qatar Airlines, as the host nation of the World Cup, would offer streaming services to enable passengers to watch the game from the skies. Alas, this was not to be, and I was left to experience the thrill of the game vicariously through the enthusiasm of my fellow passengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eAs my plane touched down in Doha, I was greeted by the lively chants and boisterous cheers of locals and travelers alike, all of whom were gathered in front of massive screens, riveted to the World Cup Final. With the match headed into extra time, I knew I was in the right place at the right time to witness history in the making. And then it happened: Lionel Messi lifted the coveted trophy, and the air was thick with jubilation and exultation. In that moment, I felt an unparalleled sense of joy, sharing this thrilling experience with perfect strangers in the airport in Doha.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eThough my transit in Doha was lengthy – a whopping 19 hours – I spent much of my time seeking out a quiet sleeping pod to rest my weary body. It was during this time that I encountered a fellow traveler, also in the midst of a lengthy transit to JFK, New York. He was a frequent flyer, having spent nearly a decade in the United States and was a member of a prestigious lounge at the Doha Airport. We struck up a conversation, and I was delighted to hear his tales of adventure and struggles. Hours flew by as we shared our stories, and we parted ways with a promise to keep in touch through social media. Though his transit was only 13 hours, our encounter left an indelible mark on me, and I spent the rest of my time strolling around the airport and chatting with friends and family, eagerly awaiting my next flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cdiv style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003e\n            \u003cimg src=\"/images/photography/fairlanewoods.png\" alt=\"woods\" style=\"max-width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;\"\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eAs I boarded my 15-hour flight to Seattle, my heart was filled with anticipation for the long-awaited reunion with my dearest sister. The hours flew by as I drifted in and out of sleep, indulged in movies, and sipped on a few drinks. However, I couldn't shake off the anxiety about the immigration officer's questions. After all, I was entering through Seattle, even though my destination was Michigan. Thankfully, the officer turned out to be warm and friendly, and I was able to move on and meet my sister at the terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eOn the day of my arrival, the weather was gloomy, but my sister's warm embrace made me feel right at home. I was thrilled at the prospect of spending time with her, my brother-in-law, and my nephew. Though my initial days were filled with challenges, including a broken phone and limited outings, I began to appreciate the little things in life. I lived in the moment, basked in the present, and enjoyed every minute with my loved ones. My sister went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. She prepared a diverse range of cuisines, and over meals, we poured our hearts out, discussing family and life events. I am forever grateful to her for making my stay memorable. Though I may never be able to express my gratitude fully, her kindness and hospitality will always be etched in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eSeattle will always hold a special place in my heart. I remember the days spent strolling through Pike Place Market, admiring the Space Needle, taking in the scenic views at Alki Beach, and exploring the fascinating exhibits at the Museum of Pop Culture. We also embarked on thrilling hikes to Snoqualmie Falls and Rattlesnake Ledge, where we immersed ourselves in the breathtaking beauty of Washington's natural landscape. Celebrating Christmas and New Year's with friends and family in Seattle was a unique and unforgettable experience, where I connected with some amazing Nepalese brothers and sisters. We visited charming towns like Fall City, Issaquah, Redmond, Sammamish, and Renton, and I even joined the Green Lake Running Group for the 10k run, the first run of the year. It was the most incredible vacation I have ever had! My sister gifted me a Pixel phone, and I got to learn a lot about navigating my university life in the US from the wonderful people I met in Seattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eThose glorious 14 days came to an end, and it was time to move on to my graduate student life at the University of Michigan Dearborn. On January 3rd, 2023, I boarded Delta Airlines and flew to Detroit, Michigan. Though I had arranged for a pickup from the airport with a student organization at the University, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness as I left the comfort of my sister's home. However, I was also excited for the challenges and learning experiences that awaited me as I ventured into independent living.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eSeattle will always hold a special place in my heart. I remember the days spent strolling through Upon arriving in Detroit, I was greeted and promptly whisked away from the airport. I had anticipated that Michigan in January would be covered in a blanket of snow, but surprisingly, it was not! Upon arrival at my apartment building, I was welcomed with open arms by a friend and fellow Nepali, whom I had only dreamed of studying with. In the first few days, we had a blast learning to cook, do laundry, navigate the university, and most importantly, learning to live together in Dearborn. I was grateful to be living with such amazing roommates who were both helpful and understanding. It was quite an adventure for the first 15 days, as there were four of us squeezed into one room, with little personal space, but ample opportunities to get to know each other. Despite the cramped conditions, we were all on the same page, and we were living for the fun of it, knowing that it was only temporary.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eAs international students, we all have certain preconceived notions and expectations of university life in the US. I can only speak for myself, but I certainly had certain feelings and ideas of what I was anticipating. I knew that the Dearborn campus of the University of Michigan was relatively small, so it was not a letdown at all. Despite the smaller campus size, it was still cozy and accessible. The professors were friendly and approachable, and the people were warm, despite the chilly weather. It finally started snowing in February.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eDespite the relatively unremarkable campus, I absolutely love the neighborhood we live in, Fairlane Woods. It feels like we are living amid a wild forest, with a small pond and ducks adding to the peaceful atmosphere. The gym is quiet, and the leasing office is warm and inviting, with some of the most thoughtful and kind people I've ever met. As most of the graduate students in our college are from neighboring nation, India, the conversations and experiences at the leasing office add to the diversity that I was anticipating. I used to meditate outdoors beside the pond, but now I work out and meditate inside the gym, as it is freezing outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eOne of the most exciting days so far was moving day! We found a beautiful, bright, spacious, and clean apartment and were thrilled to be moving into it. I had never experienced moving out and moving in before, and let me tell you, it was quite a lot of work, even though we were only moving a short distance away. Luckily, some of our new friends from the leasing office lent us their time, their cars, and their moving cart, making the process much easier. It took four full days to move our few things, but it was well worth it. We were happy and excited to call this place our own. Living with others can be challenging, without any space for honesty, but I feel fortunate that my roommates and I talk things out as they arise, building upon these small stories. This is why it has not been so difficult to live with them, and hopefully, the feeling is mutual.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eLiving on our own has its charms; life seems to move at a rapid pace, as there are hardly any dull moments. Between attending university classes, completing assignments, doing home chores, and keeping in touch with friends and family, it feels like time just flies by. And I must say, it has been delightful!\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eHowever, one significant downside is that it's almost impossible to do anything in Dearborn without a car. Even walking to the nearest grocery store is out of the question. Fortunately, the university shuttle takes us to the grocery store every week on Saturdays. Though, there are moments when I am shocked to see how expensive everything is, and I start counting the banknotes in rupees at the counter. But eventually, we acclimate ourselves to the world around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eThe university offers many events, ensuring that there is always something to do. And when I need some time to myself, I can take a stroll along the nature trail to Fair Lane Lake or Rouge River, both located within the university's periphery. Although I have been running around Michigan Avenue, I have yet to venture into any of the cafes. I did get a chance to go to Detroit Downtown, but that is a story for another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eIt's been quite a journey so far - I've made new friends, picked up useful life skills, familiarized myself with the city's geography, settled into university life, connected with some inspiring professors, and even pursued a certification. However, there's still so much more to experience and explore, and I'm eagerly waiting to get behind the wheel and hit the road. After all, having a car in the US is almost a necessity!\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eWith numerous expectations to meet and a plethora of challenges to overcome, I'm learning to manage my time more effectively. I'm prioritizing my goals, creating actionable plans, and striving to strike a healthy balance in my daily routine. Life has taught me to adjust my expectations, and I'm slowly but surely learning to adapt to the ebb and flow of life's challenges. It's a constant battle, but I'm determined to emerge stronger and wiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for reading my story.

Alongside the government and a diverse team of passionate individuals, we embarked on a mission to bridge educational disparities through technology—a mission that became even more crucial during the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cimg src=\"/images/mystory/mountain.png\" alt=\"mountain\" style=\"display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\"\u003e\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px; color: #666;\"\u003eImage: Depicting beauty of Nepal, trekking in Everest region\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 16px;\"\u003eWhat truly set EPaath apart for me was witnessing its transformative impact firsthand. Leading the development team, my journey extended far beyond programming. We immersed ourselves in the communities we served, engaging with students, educators, and families across Nepal. The insights and stories we gathered were humbling and pivotal in refining EPaath, driving home the profound influence of technology in addressing real-world challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cimg src=\"/images/mystory/epaath.png\" alt=\"epaath\" style=\"display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\"\u003e\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px; color: #666;\"\u003eImage: Student learning content using EPaath\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 16px;\"\u003eThis project holds a special place in my heart, not merely for its statistical achievements but for the profound personal and professional growth it spurred. It solidified my belief in technology's capacity to foster positive change and propelled me to pursue further innovation at the MIT Game Lab. There, I explored the intersection of gaming and education, focusing on enhancing math and science learning. My transition from the rural classrooms of Nepal to the inventive corridors of MIT encapsulates my dedication to leveraging technology for societal benefit. This journey has been exhilarating—an exploration of potential, impact, and inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cimg src=\"/images/mystory/mitregan.png\" alt=\"regan\" style=\"display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\"\u003e\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px; color: #666;\"\u003eImage: Speaking at MIT JWEL Education Conference about the games we designed at OLE Nepal\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 24px; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003eLinks to check out:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"https://olenepal.org/digital-learning-solutions/\" style=\"color: #0657f9; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOLE Nepal Digital Learning Solutions\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"https://epaath.olenepal.org/\" style=\"color: #0657f9; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEPaath\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"https://games.olenepal.org/\" style=\"color: #0657f9; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOLE Nepal Games\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n","---\ntitle: Why I love Running\ndate: 2023-10-02\n---\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003e\n    \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eReflections on Running\u003c/title\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody style=\"margin:0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #f4f4f4; color: #333; padding: 20px; text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n    \u003cheader style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;\"\u003e\n        \u003ch1 style=\"color: #2a7a7b;\"\u003eReflections on Running\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003c/header\u003e\n    \u003csection\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eI love to run. मलाई running गर्न ‍‌एकदम मनपर्छ!! I feel like I have always been running. I can’t remember a time in my life when I was not running.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eExperts will tell you कि running is good for your muscles, your bones, your मुटु and more importantly to your mind, as it relieves stress. तर, म यहाँ पुरा running को health benefits को बारे कुरा गर्न आएको चाहिँ हैन है! म आफु दाैडेर,आफुले भाेगेको, सिकेको थोरै experience हरु share गर्न आएको हुँ।\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eRunning uphill usually looks very difficult but is much safer; whereas, running downhill is perceived to be easier, but is much more riskier. The same can be said about our experiences in life. What looks at first sight to be difficult could in fact be less dangerous, and what looks simple could be filled with challenges. So, let us not assume the choices that we encounter everyday simply based on what they appear to be. Let’s also learn to weigh in on the myriad of extensions that these choices bring with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eRunning alone can be fun. However, it presents its own set of challenges, especially when you are out there in the wild. So, always have company not just in your running but also in different aspects of your lives. The people around you allow you to see things that you might not be acutely aware of. They can provide direction, they can instill motivation, they can give support, and more importantly, they are able to contribute towards your experiences and add new meanings to them. So, it is not just about running, but equally about who you are running with.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eRunners will tell you to carry light or carry what is necessary. Running is all about optimisation. It is about knowing what is required and only carrying so much. We tend to burden our lives with things that we do not need and carry unnecessary loads, in the hope that someday we might find it useful or that someday that person might come back to us. Let’s learn to leave our burdens on the side and move forward with what our life situations necessitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eYou can easily get lost when you are running. I can’t remember the number of times me and my friends have been lost, no matter how prepared we were. We have now learned that being lost is part of running. We have begun to accept it as part of our experience. However, what is more important is to keep going. Now, we don’t sit down and worry about what went wrong. We look for new ways to explore how we can keep on moving. This always leads us to new roads and new possibilities. So, the next time you are lost or stuck in some instance of your life, don’t think that it is the end. Think of it as the beginning of a new path.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003e\n            \u003cimg src=\"/images/mystory/mountain.png\" alt=\"Running\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;\"\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eThe view from the top is awesome, and there is no doubt about it. However, I can say with some level of certainty that the fleeting moments while we run are equally beautiful. What makes our runs endearing are not just these goals of getting to the top but the myriads of emotions that become part of our running - whether it is anticipation, fatigue, joy or discovery. Through running, we learn to embrace our emotions. It helps us to grasp and understand not just our bodies but also our minds. Therefore, to me, running is not about reaching somewhere to get a view. It is about exploring, it is about seeking, it is about connecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eWe run, and we have always been running - sometimes running away and sometimes running towards. The next time you run - whether it's out in the woods or in your own lives - I hope you are able to reflect on a few things. Life or running is not about being fast or slow. Life or running is not about the high or the low. It is about being aware - of the world around you, of the people around you and of your own beating heart. It is about being one with yourself and the rest. It is not just about exploring the world outside of us but equally about the revelation of the world inside of us. It is indeed a form of meditation.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eTherefore, I run, not because I want to get to the top. I run because I can feel my heartbeat. I run because I can explore the rhythm of my life. I run because it helps me reconnect with the world around me. I hope all of you will find your own passion that will allow you to look back at yourself and help you fine tune the rhythm of your lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:4vh;\"\u003eThank you.
